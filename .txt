These files list the sessions I did on ChatGPT during my internship. 
I focused on the game Flappy Bird, for which I made XX sessions on ChatGPT-3.5, then a few on ChatGPT-4 when I had access to compare.
I did a session on each version of GPT for a more advanced game, Tank Wars. As I didn't notice any obvious difference and it took too long, I didn't go through with the session on GPT-4.

The Flappy Bird file is structured as follows:
> ChatGP version
   > method used (type of prompt)
      > session number
         > code
         > prompt
         > observations
         > video
