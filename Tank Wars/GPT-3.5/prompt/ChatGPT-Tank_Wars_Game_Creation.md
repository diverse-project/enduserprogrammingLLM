# Tank Wars Game Creation

#### You:
I would like to create a game similar to Tank Wars in python. Here's what I would like to have in the game:
- Two tanks facing each other ("green_tank" and "red_tank")
- One of them is controlled by a player, the other one by the computer
- There is a ground 
- Tanks can shoot projectiles that can destroy the ground

#### ChatGPT:
Sure! I can help you get started with creating a game similar to Tank Wars in Python. We'll use the Pygame library to build the game. Here's a basic outline of the steps involved:

1. Install Pygame: First, make sure you have Pygame installed on your system. You can install it using pip with the following command:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. Set up the game window: Import the Pygame library and initialize it. Create a game window with a specified width and height.
   ```python
   import pygame

   pygame.init()

   WIDTH = 800
   HEIGHT = 600

   screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
   pygame.display.set_caption("Tank Wars")
   ```

3. Create the tanks: Define classes for the green tank and the red tank. Each tank should have attributes like position, angle, and health. You can use images for the tank sprites.
   ```python
   class Tank:
       def __init__(self, x, y, image):
           self.x = x
           self.y = y
           self.image = pygame.image.load(image)
           self.angle = 0
           self.health = 100

       def draw(self):
           # Rotate the tank image based on the angle
           rotated_image = pygame.transform.rotate(self.image, self.angle)
           screen.blit(rotated_image, (self.x, self.y))
   ```

4. Draw the ground: Create a ground surface with a rectangular shape. You can use a solid color or load an image as the ground.
   ```python
   ground_color = (100, 100, 100)  # RGB value for the ground color
   ground_rect = pygame.Rect(0, HEIGHT - 50, WIDTH, 50)

   def draw_ground():
       pygame.draw.rect(screen, ground_color, ground_rect)
   ```

5. Handle user input: Add code to handle keyboard input for controlling the player's tank. You can use the arrow keys to move the tank and the spacebar to shoot projectiles.
   ```python
   def handle_input(player_tank):
       for event in pygame.event.get():
           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
               pygame.quit()
               sys.exit()
           elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
               if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                   player_tank.angle += 1  # Rotate the tank counter-clockwise
               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                   player_tank.angle -= 1  # Rotate the tank clockwise
               elif event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                   # Move the tank forward in the direction it is facing
                   player_tank.x += 1 * math.cos(math.radians(player_tank.angle))
                   player_tank.y -= 1 * math.sin(math.radians(player_tank.angle))
               elif event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                   # Create a projectile and shoot it
                   shoot_projectile(player_tank)
   ```

6. Add projectile mechanics: Define a projectile class with attributes like position, velocity, and damage. Implement the logic for shooting projectiles from the tanks and handling collisions with the ground.
   ```python
   class Projectile:
       def __init__(self, x, y, angle):
           self.x = x
           self.y = y
           self.velocity = 5
           self.angle = angle
           self.damage = 50

       def update(self):
           # Move the projectile based on its velocity and angle
           self.x += self.velocity * math.cos(math.radians(self.angle))
           self.y -= self.velocity * math.sin(math.radians(self.angle))

       def draw(self):
           pygame.draw.circle(screen, (255, 255, 255), (int(self.x), int(self.y)), 5)

   def shoot_projectile(tank):
       projectile = Projectile(tank.x, tank.y, tank.angle)
       projectiles.append(projectile)

   projectiles = []

   def handle_projectiles():
       for projectile in projectiles:
           projectile.update()

           # Check for collision with the ground
           if ground_rect.collidepoint(projectile.x, projectile.y):
               # Damage the ground or destroy it
               # ...

           projectile.draw()
   ```

7. Create the game loop: Combine all the previous steps in a game loop that updates the game state, handles input, and draws the game elements.
   ```python
   clock = pygame.time.Clock()

   player_tank = Tank(100, HEIGHT - 100, "green_tank.png")
   computer_tank = Tank(WIDTH - 100, HEIGHT - 100, "red_tank.png")

   while True:
       screen.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Clear the screen

       handle_input(player_tank)
       handle_projectiles()

       player_tank.draw()
       computer_tank.draw()
       draw_ground()

       pygame.display.flip()  # Update the contents of the entire display
       clock.tick(60)  # Limit the frame rate to 60 FPS
   ```

This is a basic framework to get you started with creating the Tank Wars game in Python using Pygame. You can expand on this foundation by adding features like tank collisions, scoring, and AI-controlled movement for the computer tank. Feel free to customize and enhance the game according to your requirements.


#### You:
The trajectory of the projectiles should be parabolic.

#### ChatGPT:
To make the trajectory of the projectiles parabolic, we can use basic physics equations to calculate the projectile's position at each frame. Here's an updated version of the projectile class that incorporates parabolic motion:

```python
import math

class Projectile:
    def __init__(self, x, y, angle):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.angle = angle
        self.velocity = 10  # Adjust the velocity as needed
        self.gravity = 0.5  # Adjust the gravity as needed
        self.time = 0

    def update(self):
        self.time += 1
        # Calculate the x and y components of the velocity
        velocity_x = self.velocity * math.cos(math.radians(self.angle))
        velocity_y = self.velocity * math.sin(math.radians(self.angle)) - self.gravity * self.time

        # Calculate the new position based on the velocity components
        self.x += velocity_x
        self.y -= velocity_y

    def draw(self):
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, (255, 255, 255), (int(self.x), int(self.y)), 5)
```

In the updated `update` method, we calculate the x and y components of the velocity based on the projectile's angle and velocity. We also consider the effect of gravity by subtracting it from the y component of the velocity. The time variable is incremented by 1 at each frame to simulate the passage of time.

Feel free to adjust the velocity and gravity values to achieve the desired projectile motion. The higher the velocity, the faster the projectile will travel, and the higher the gravity, the faster the projectile will fall.

With this updated projectile class, the projectiles will follow a parabolic trajectory when fired from the tanks.


#### You:
I modified the code like so:

import pygame
import math
import sys
import time

pygame.init()

WIDTH = 800
HEIGHT = 600
space = 0

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Tank Wars")

class Tank:
    def __init__(self, x, y, image):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.image = pygame.image.load(image)
        self.angle = 0
        self.health = 100

    def draw(self):
        # Rotate the tank image based on the angle
        rotated_image = pygame.transform.rotate(self.image, self.angle)
        screen.blit(rotated_image, (self.x, self.y))

ground_color = (100, 100, 100)  # RGB value for the ground color
ground_rect = pygame.Rect(0, HEIGHT - 50, WIDTH, 50)

def draw_ground():
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, ground_color, ground_rect)


def handle_input(player_tank):
    global space, start, end
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_z]:
        player_tank.angle += 1  # Rotate the tank counter-clockwise
    elif keys[pygame.K_s]:
        player_tank.angle -= 1  # Rotate the tank clockwise
    if keys[pygame.K_d]:
        # Move the tank forward in the direction it is facing
        player_tank.x += 1 * math.cos(math.radians(player_tank.angle))
        player_tank.y -= 1 * math.sin(math.radians(player_tank.angle))
    elif keys[pygame.K_q]:
        # Move the tank forward in the direction it is facing
        player_tank.x -= 1 * math.cos(math.radians(player_tank.angle))
        player_tank.y += 1 * math.sin(math.radians(player_tank.angle))

    if space == 1:
        start = time.time()
    
    if keys[pygame.K_SPACE]:
        # Create a projectile and shoot it
        space += 1
    
    else:
        if space:
            space = 0
            end = time.time()
            velocity = (end - start)*12 + 6
            shoot_projectile(player_tank, velocity)

class Projectile:
    def __init__(self, x, y, angle, velocity):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.angle = angle
        self.velocity = velocity  # Adjust the velocity as needed
        self.gravity = 0.5  # Adjust the gravity as needed
        self.time = 0

    def update(self):
        self.time += 1

        velocity_y = self.velocity * math.sin(math.radians(self.angle)) - self.gravity * self.time

        # Calculate the new position based on the velocity components
        self.x += velocity_x
        self.y -= velocity_y

    def draw(self):
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, (255, 255, 255), (int(self.x), int(self.y)), 5)

def shoot_projectile(tank, velocity):
    projectile = Projectile(tank.x+18, tank.y+3, tank.angle+45, velocity)
    projectiles.append(projectile)

projectiles = []

def handle_projectiles():
    for projectile in projectiles:
        projectile.update()

        # Check for collision with the ground
        if ground_rect.collidepoint(projectile.x, projectile.y):
            # Damage the ground or destroy it
            # ...
            pass

        projectile.draw()

clock = pygame.time.Clock()

computer_tank = Tank(WIDTH - 100, HEIGHT - 100, "assets/red_tank.png")

while True:
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Clear the screen

    handle_input(player_tank)
    handle_projectiles()

    player_tank.draw()
    computer_tank.draw()
    draw_ground()

    pygame.display.flip()  # Update the contents of the entire display
    clock.tick(60)  # Limit the frame rate to 60 FPS

Now, I would like to add a destructible ground, like in a classic Tank Wars game.

#### ChatGPT:
To create a destructible ground, we can use a 2D array to represent the ground's structure. Each element in the array will indicate the height of the ground at that point. We'll update the ground based on the projectiles' impact.

Here's an updated version of the code that includes a destructible ground:

```python
import pygame
import math
import sys
import time

pygame.init()

WIDTH = 800
HEIGHT = 600
space = 0

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Tank Wars")

class Tank:
    def __init__(self, x, y, image):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.image = pygame.image.load(image)
        self.angle = 0
        self.health = 100

    def draw(self):
        # Rotate the tank image based on the angle
        rotated_image = pygame.transform.rotate(self.image, self.angle)
        screen.blit(rotated_image, (self.x, self.y))

ground_color = (100, 100, 100)  # RGB value for the ground color
ground_rect = pygame.Rect(0, HEIGHT - 50, WIDTH, 50)

# Define the ground structure as a 2D array
ground = []
ground_width = WIDTH // 10  # Each element represents a column of pixels
ground_height = 50
ground_depth = 10  # Adjust the depth of the ground

for _ in range(ground_width):
    ground.append([HEIGHT - ground_height] * ground_depth)

def draw_ground():
    for x in range(ground_width):
        for y in range(ground_depth):
            pygame.draw.rect(screen, ground_color, (x * 10, ground[x][y], 10, ground_height - ground[x][y]))

def handle_input(player_tank):
    global space, start, end
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_z]:
        player_tank.angle += 1  # Rotate the tank counter-clockwise
    elif keys[pygame.K_s]:
        player_tank.angle -= 1  # Rotate the tank clockwise
    if keys[pygame.K_d]:
        # Move the tank forward in the direction it is facing
        player_tank.x += 1 * math.cos(math.radians(player_tank.angle))
        player_tank.y -= 1 * math.sin(math.radians(player_tank.angle))
    elif keys[pygame.K_q]:
        # Move the tank forward in the direction it is facing
        player_tank.x -= 1 * math.cos(math.radians(player_tank.angle))
        player_tank.y += 1 * math.sin(math.radians(player_tank.angle))

    if space == 1:
        start = time.time()
    
    if keys[pygame.K_SPACE]:
        # Create a projectile and shoot it
        space += 1
    
    else:
        if space:
            space = 0
            end = time.time()
            velocity = (end - start)*12 + 6
            shoot_projectile(player_tank, velocity)

class Projectile:
    def __init__(self, x, y, angle, velocity):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.angle = angle
        self.velocity = velocity  # Adjust the velocity as needed
        self.gravity = 0.5  # Adjust the gravity as needed
        self.time = 0

    def update(self):
        self.time += 1
        # Calculate the x and y components of the velocity
        velocity_x = self.velocity * math.cos(math.radians(self.angle))
        velocity_y = self.velocity * math.sin(math.radians(self.angle)) - self.gravity * self.time

        # Calculate the new position based on the velocity components
        self.x += velocity_x
        self.y -= velocity_y

        # Update the ground structure based on the projectile's impact
        ground_x = int(self.x // 10)
        ground_y = int((HEIGHT - self.y) // 10)
        if 0 <= ground_x < ground_width and 0 <= ground_y < ground_depth:
            ground[ground_x][ground_y] = min(ground[ground_x][ground_y], HEIGHT - self.y)

    def draw(self):
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, (255, 255, 255), (int(self.x), int(self.y)), 5)

def shoot_projectile(tank, velocity):
    projectile = Projectile(tank.x+18, tank.y+3, tank.angle+45, velocity)
    projectiles.append(projectile)

projectiles = []

def handle_projectiles():
    for projectile in projectiles:
        projectile.update()

        # Check for collision with the ground
        if ground_rect.collidepoint(projectile.x, projectile.y):
            # Damage the ground or destroy it
            # ...
            pass

        projectile.draw()

clock = pygame.time.Clock()

player_tank = Tank(100, HEIGHT - 100, "assets/green_tank.png")
computer_tank = Tank(WIDTH - 100, HEIGHT - 100, "assets/red_tank.png")

while True:
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Clear the screen

    handle_input(player_tank)
    handle_projectiles()

    player_tank.draw()
    computer_tank.draw()
    draw_ground()

    pygame.display.flip()  # Update the contents of the entire display
    clock.tick(60)  # Limit the frame rate to 60 FPS
```

In this updated code, we added a 2D array called `ground` to represent the structure of the ground. Each element of the array represents the height of the ground at a specific point. We initialize the ground array with a default height value.

Inside the `update` method of the `Projectile` class, we calculate the position of the projectile as before. We then calculate the corresponding index in the `ground` array based on the projectile's position. If the projectile collides with the ground, we update the ground's height value at that point.

The `draw_ground` function has been updated to draw the ground based on the values in the `ground` array. We use rectangles to draw each column of pixels, adjusting the height based on the ground's height value.

Now, when a projectile hits the ground, it will leave a mark and alter the ground's structure accordingly.


#### You:
When I shoot a projectile, ground appears on the top of the screen.

#### ChatGPT:
Apologies for the issue. It seems that the ground is appearing at the top of the screen because the `ground_rect` is not being properly positioned. Let's update the code to ensure that the ground is positioned correctly at the bottom of the screen.

Please replace the existing `draw_ground()` function with the following code:

```python
def draw_ground():
    for x in range(ground_width):
        for y in range(ground_depth):
            pygame.draw.rect(
                screen,
                ground_color,
                (x * 10, HEIGHT - ground[x][y] - ground_height, 10, ground_height - ground[x][y])
            )
```

In this updated code, we subtract the `ground[x][y]` value from the bottom of the screen (`HEIGHT`) to correctly position the ground at the bottom. This way, the ground should appear in the intended location rather than at the top of the screen.

With this modification, the ground should be properly positioned at the bottom of the screen, and the projectiles will update the ground structure upon impact.


#### You:
The ground should disapear when shooting a projectile, not appear!

#### ChatGPT:
Apologies for the confusion. To make the ground disappear when a projectile hits it, we can modify the `handle_projectiles()` function to update the ground structure and remove the corresponding ground elements upon impact.

Replace the `handle_projectiles()` function with the following code:

```python
def handle_projectiles():
    global ground

    for projectile in projectiles:
        projectile.update()

        # Check for collision with the ground
        if ground_rect.collidepoint(projectile.x, projectile.y):
            # Update the ground structure based on the projectile's impact
            ground_x = int(projectile.x // 10)
            ground_y = int((HEIGHT - projectile.y) // 10)
            if 0 <= ground_x < ground_width and 0 <= ground_y < ground_depth:
                ground[ground_x][ground_y] = HEIGHT

        projectile.draw()

    # Remove ground elements that have reached the top of the screen
    ground = [[min(ground_x, HEIGHT - ground_height) for ground_x in ground_column] for ground_column in ground]
```

In this updated code, we add a global variable `ground` to ensure that we can modify the ground structure within the function. We iterate over the projectiles and update their positions as before. If a projectile collides with the ground, we set the corresponding ground element's value to `HEIGHT`, which will make it disappear from the screen.

After updating all the projectiles, we remove ground elements that have reached the top of the screen. We use a list comprehension to create a new `ground` array where any element with a value of `HEIGHT` is replaced with `HEIGHT - ground_height`. This ensures that the ground appears at the bottom of the screen while any destroyed sections are removed.

With these changes, when a projectile hits the ground, the corresponding section of the ground will disappear.


#### You:
But there's no ground to begin with.

#### ChatGPT:
Apologies for the confusion. To initially create a ground and then update it to disappear upon impact, we can make a few modifications. Here's the updated code:

In this updated code, we initialize the ground array with the initial height values for each column. The ground structure is then updated in the `handle_projectiles()` function when a projectile collides with the ground. We use `max()` when updating the ground to ensure that the ground structure only increases in height.

Now, when a projectile hits the ground, the corresponding sections of the ground will disappear, giving the appearance of destructible terrain.


#### You:
That still doesn't work. Maybe I should create a python file with a "map", which looks like this:
MAP=[
[0,0,0,0,],
[0,0,1,1],
[1,1,1,1]
]
But bigger, and with the 0 being the sky and the 1 being the ground. 

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly! Using a map to represent the ground is a good approach. You can create a separate Python file with the map data and import it into your main game file. Here's an example:

**ground\_map.py**:

```python
MAP = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1],
    # Add more rows as needed
]
```

In your main game file, you can import the `MAP` from `ground_map.py` and use it to initialize and update the ground structure. Here's an updated version of the code:

**main.py**:

```python
import pygame

        self.angle = 0
        self.health = 100

    def draw(self):
        # Rotate the tank image based on the angle
        rotated_image = pygame.transform.rotate(self.image, self.angle)
        screen.blit(rotated_image, (self.x, self.y))

ground_color = (100, 100, 100)  # RGB value for the ground color

```

In this updated code, we import the `MAP` from the `ground_map.py` file and use it to initialize the ground structure. Each element in the `MAP` represents whether the corresponding position is ground (1) or sky (0). We iterate over the map data and set the initial ground height based on its value.

Now, you can define a larger and more complex map in the `ground_map.py` file, and the ground structure will be initialized and updated accordingly in the main game file.

Please ensure that you have both the `main.py` file and the `ground_map.py` file in the same directory or provide the appropriate file path when importing the `MAP` variable.


#### You:
What is the ground list for?

#### ChatGPT:
Apologies for the confusion. The `ground` list in the updated code is used to store the current state of the ground structure. Each element in the list represents the height of the ground at a specific position. The purpose of the `ground` list is to keep track of the current height of the ground columns.

Here's a breakdown of how the `ground` list is used:

1. The `ground` list is initialized with default values representing the initial height of the ground in each column. The height values are obtained from the `MAP` data.

2. In the `draw_ground()` function, the `ground` list is used to determine the height of each ground column when drawing it on the screen. The height values are used to calculate the y-coordinate of each rectangle representing a ground column.

3. In the `handle_projectiles()` function, the `ground` list is updated based on the impact of projectiles. When a projectile collides with the ground, the corresponding element in the `ground` list is updated to the maximum value between the current height and the height of the projectile impact point. This ensures that the ground remains at the highest point of impact.

4. At the end of the `handle_projectiles()` function, ground elements that have reached the top of the screen are adjusted to the appropriate height. This is done to ensure that the ground appears at the bottom of the screen while destroyed sections are removed.

In summary, the `ground` list is used to store and update the current state of the ground structure. It allows the game to keep track of the ground's height at each position and modify it accordingly based on projectile impacts.

Now, I would like the tank to stay on the ground (and not be able to float or pass through the ground), and be able to climb when there's a one block difference in height.

#### ChatGPT:
To make the tank stay on the ground and allow it to climb when there's a one-block difference in height, you'll need to modify the `handle_input()` function and add some additional logic to handle tank movement and collisions with the ground.

Here's an updated version of the `handle_input()` function that implements the desired behavior:

```python
def handle_input(player_tank):
    global space, start, end
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_z]:
        player_tank.angle += 1  # Rotate the tank counter-clockwise
    elif keys[pygame.K_s]:
        player_tank.angle -= 1  # Rotate the tank clockwise

    # Calculate the new position based on the tank's angle and movement direction
    new_x = player_tank.x + math.cos(math.radians(player_tank.angle))
    new_y = player_tank.y - math.sin(math.radians(player_tank.angle))

    # Check if the tank is within the screen boundaries
    if 0 <= new_x <= WIDTH - player_tank.image.get_width() and 0 <= new_y <= HEIGHT - player_tank.image.get_height():
        ground_x = int(new_x // 20)
        ground_y = int(new_y // 20)

        # Check if the tank is on the ground or can climb a one-block difference in height
        if ground_y >= 0 and ground_y < ground_depth and MAP[ground_y][ground_x] == 1:
            player_tank.x = new_x
            player_tank.y = new_y
        elif ground_y - 1 >= 0 and ground_y - 1 < ground_depth and MAP[ground_y - 1][ground_x] == 1 and abs(new_y - ground_y * 20) <= 1:
            player_tank.x = new_x
            player_tank.y = new_y

    if keys[pygame.K_SPACE]:
        # Create a projectile and shoot it
        space += 1
    else:
        if space:
            space = 0
            end = time.time()
            velocity = (end - start) * 12 + 6
            shoot_projectile(player_tank, velocity)
```

In this updated code, we calculate the new position of the tank based on its angle and movement direction. We check if the tank is within the screen boundaries and then determine the corresponding ground position (`ground_x` and `ground_y`).

Next, we check if the tank is on the ground or if there's a one-block difference in height that allows it to climb. If the conditions are met, we update the tank's position accordingly.

Now, the tank will stay on the ground and be able to climb a one-block difference in height. If the tank tries to move into an area where it cannot go, it will be stopped and won't pass through the ground.

Feel free to adjust the code as needed to match your specific requirements or add any additional functionality.

I would like the tank to fall down if there's no ground directly below it.

#### ChatGPT:
To make the tank fall down if there's no ground directly below it, you'll need to modify the `handle_input()` function and add logic to check for the presence of ground in the downward direction.

Here's an updated version of the `handle_input()` function that implements this behavior:

```python
def handle_input(player_tank):
    global space, start, end
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_z] and player_tank.angle < 45:
        player_tank.angle += 1  # Rotate the tank counter-clockwise
    elif keys[pygame.K_s] and player_tank.angle > -45:
        player_tank.angle -= 1  # Rotate the tank clockwise
    
    if keys[pygame.K_d]:
        # Calculate the new position based on the tank's angle and movement direction
        new_x = player_tank.x + math.cos(math.radians(player_tank.angle))
        new_y = player_tank.y - math.sin(math.radians(player_tank.angle))

        # Check if the tank is within the screen boundaries
        if 0 <= new_x <= WIDTH - player_tank.image.get_width() and 0 <= new_y <= HEIGHT - player_tank.image.get_height():
            ground_x = int(new_x // 20)
            ground_y = int(new_y // 20)
            # Check if the tank is on the ground or can climb a one-block difference in height
            if ground_y + 2 >= 0 and ground_y + 2 < ground_depth and MAP[ground_y + 2][ground_x] == 1:
                player_tank.x = new_x
                player_tank.y = new_y
            elif ground_y - 1 >= 0 and ground_y - 1 < ground_depth and MAP[ground_y - 1][ground_x] == 1 and abs(new_y - ground_y * 20) <= 1:
                player_tank.x = new_x
                player_tank.y = new_y
            else:
                # Check if there's ground directly below the tank
                if ground_y + 1 < ground_depth and MAP[ground_y + 1][ground_x] == 1:
                    # Fall down if there's ground below
                    player_tank.y += 1

    if keys[pygame.K_q]:
        # Calculate the new position based on the tank's angle and movement direction
        new_x = player_tank.x - math.cos(math.radians(player_tank.angle))
        new_y = player_tank.y + math.sin(math.radians(player_tank.angle))

        # Check if the tank is within the screen boundaries
        if 0 <= new_x <= WIDTH - player_tank.image.get_width() and 0 <= new_y <= HEIGHT - player_tank.image.get_height():
            ground_x = int(new_x // 20)
            ground_y = int(new_y // 20)
            # Check if the tank is on the ground or can climb a one-block difference in height
            if ground_y + 2 >= 0 and ground_y + 2 < ground_depth and MAP[ground_y + 2][ground_x] == 1:
                player_tank.x = new_x
                player_tank.y = new_y
            elif ground_y - 1 >= 0 and ground_y - 1 < ground_depth and MAP[ground_y - 1][ground_x] == 1 and abs(new_y - ground_y * 20) <= 1:
                player_tank.x = new_x
                player_tank.y = new_y
            else:
                # Check if there's ground directly below the tank
                if ground_y + 1 < ground_depth and MAP[ground_y + 1][ground_x] == 1:
                    # Fall down if there's ground below
                    player_tank.y += 1

    if space == 1:
        start = time.time()
    if keys[pygame.K_SPACE]:
        # Create a projectile and shoot it
        space += 1
    else:
        if space:
            space = 0
            end = time.time()
            velocity = (end - start) * 12 + 6
            shoot_projectile(player_tank, velocity)
```

In this updated code, after calculating the new position of the tank, we check if there's ground directly below it by comparing the `ground_y + 1` position with the ground depth and checking if it's a valid ground block (`MAP[ground_y + 1][ground_x] == 1`). If there's ground below, we do nothing.

However, if there's no ground directly below the tank, we increase the tank's y-coordinate by 1 to simulate falling down.

Now, the tank will stay on the ground and only fall down if there's no ground directly below it. You can adjust the code as needed to match your specific requirements or add any additional functionality.

```

In this updated code, the `handle_ai()` function is added to handle the AI logic for the red tank. The AI rotates the tank's turret to aim at the player tank and calculates the distance between the tanks. If the distance is less than 300 units, the red tank shoots a projectile at the player tank.

You can adjust the AI behavior, such as the shooting distance or projectile velocity, as per your requirements.

To end the game when either the player or the computer tank has been shot three times, you can introduce a health tracking mechanism for both tanks and update the game logic accordingly. Here's the modified code with the game ending condition:

In this modified code, the `check_game_over()` function is added to check the game over condition. The function is called within the game loop to determine if either the player tank or the computer tank has a health value of 0 or less. If the condition is met, the game ends by quitting the pygame window and exiting the program.

Please note that you may need to update the health value of the tanks accordingly based on the game logic you have in place.

In the modified code, the `Projectile` class is updated to check for collisions with the player tank. If a collision occurs, the player tank's health is reduced by 1, and the projectile is removed from the list of projectiles.

You can adjust the health reduction logic as per your requirements. Additionally, you can also add visual feedback or game effects when a tank's health is reduced to enhance the gameplay experience.

I would like to display the tanks' health with images ("green_heart_full.png", "green_heart_mid.png", "green_heart_low.png" and "green_heart_empty.png" for the player's tank, and "red_heart_full.png", "red_heart_mid.png", "red_heart_low.png" and "red_heart_empty.png" for the computer's tank)
