Simple description of what the game should include.

example:
Write the code for a Flappy Bird game in python. 
I have a folder 'assets' with 'background.png', 'pipe.png' and 'bird.png'. 
I would like to know my score and keep track of my highcore in a separate file.
I would like to have a start screen when I first open the game, where I can see my highscore, and a game over screen where I can see my score, highscore and play again.
