We give a working code to ChatGPT and ask it to write us a prompt able to give us a similar code.

PROMPT:
Create a Flappy Bird game using Pygame. The game should have the following features:

- The game window should be 288x512 pixels in size.
- The background, bird, base, and pipe assets should be loaded and displayed on the screen.
- The bird should be able to jump when the spacebar is pressed.
- Pipes should spawn at regular intervals and move from right to left.
- The bird should be able to collide with the pipes, the top/bottom of the screen, or the base.
- The score should increase when the bird successfully passes a pair of pipes.
- The game should end when the bird collides with an obstacle.
- The highest score achieved should be displayed on the screen, along with the option to restart the game.

Please provide the necessary code to implement the above features using the Pygame library.




API folder:
I tried to use the API to make several tries with the same prompt. The results were not so good, maybe because the temperature I used was not the same as in the web version.
