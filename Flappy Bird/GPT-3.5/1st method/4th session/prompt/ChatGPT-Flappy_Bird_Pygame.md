# Flappy Bird Pygame

#### You:
Create a Flappy Bird game using Pygame. The game window should have a width of 288 and a height of 512, with the caption "Flappy Bird". The game should include the following elements: 
1. Load the game assets: a background image ("assets/background.png"), a bird image ("assets/bird.png"), a pipe image ("assets/pipe.png"), and a cloud image (“assets/cloud.png”). 
2. Define a Bird class that represents the player's bird. The bird should have an initial position at the center of the window, no initial velocity, and a gravity of 0.5. The class should have methods to update the bird's position, make it jump, and check for collisions with the window boundaries. 
3. Define a Pipe class that represents the pipes the bird has to navigate through. The class should have parameters for the pipe's x and y positions, as well as a Boolean parameter indicating whether the pipe is inverted or not. The class should have a method to update the pipe's position and check if it is offscreen. 
4. Define a Cloud class that represents the clouds in the background. The class should have parameters for the cloud's x and y positions, as well as its speed. The class should have a method to update the cloud's position and check if it is offscreen. 
5. Create groups for the birds, pipes, and clouds using the Pygame sprite module. 
6. Implement a start_game() function that initializes the game state, including the bird, pipe spawn timer, score, and font. The function should return these initialized variables. 
7. Implement functions to load and save the high score from a file called "high_score.txt". The high score should be initialized as 0 if the file does not exist or is empty. 
8. Set up the game loop, which will continue running until the user closes the game window. Inside the loop, handle events such as quitting the game, jumping the bird with the space key, and spawning new pipes using a timer. Update the game state, including the bird's position, collisions, score, pipe speed, and pipe spawn timer interval. Finally, draw the game elements, including the background, clouds, birds, pipes, and score, and update the display. 
9. When the game is over, display a game over screen that shows the player's score and the high score. Offer an option to restart the game by pressing the space key. 
10. Quit the game and close the Pygame window when the game loop is exited. Make sure to use the provided images and code structure to create a functional Flappy Bird game.

```

Make sure to have the `assets` folder with the required images (`background.png`, `bird.png`, `pipe.png`, `cloud.png`) in the same directory as the Python script. You'll also need to have Pygame installed in your Python environment.

This code sets up the game window, loads the game assets, defines the Bird, Pipe, and Cloud classes, creates the necessary sprite groups, implements the game loop, handles events, updates the game state, checks for collisions, and draws the game elements. It also includes functions for loading and saving the high score and a game over screen.

Note that the code does not handle collision detection between the bird and the pipes, so you might want to add that functionality if desired.

Feel free to modify and customize the code to fit your needs. Enjoy coding and have fun playing Flappy Bird!
