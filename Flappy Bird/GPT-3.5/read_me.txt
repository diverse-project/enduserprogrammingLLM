In each folder are the different approaches I could think of to get ChatGPT to write code.

1st method: We give a working code to ChatGPT and ask it to write us a prompt able to give us a similar code.
2nd method: List of characteristics/features the game should have. 
3rd method: Simple prompt (Write a Flappy Bird game in python).
4th method: Simple description of what the game should include.
5th method: A series of requests that I give to ChatGPT, without changing the code between them.

left_to_right: A session where I ask ChatGPT to invert the game.
