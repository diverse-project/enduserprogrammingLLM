I tried to find a list of request I could give to ChatGPT to have a good Flappy Bird game without having to modify the code.

For the first 3 sessions, I was regenerating ChatGPT's answers, so even if I had good results, they don't really count as "good sessions". It was mostly to help me find good requests.
