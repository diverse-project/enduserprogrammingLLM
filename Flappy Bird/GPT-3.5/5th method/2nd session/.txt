Write a code in python. There is a bird ('bird.png') centered on the left side of the screen. The bird moves downward due to gravity, and flaps its wings to rise a constant height when the spacebar is pressed. When making the bird flap its wings, don't forget to reset the bird's speed to 0. Use the pygame library. The window size should be 800x600. Don't forget to implement a clock.
