Write a code in python. There is a bird ('bird.png') centered on the left side of the screen. The bird falls slowly due to gravity, but can flap its wings and rise a determined height when the spacebar is pressed. Use the pygame library. The window size should be 800x600. Don't forget to implement a clock.

Now, can you add animations and rotation to the bird? I have 3 frames : 'bird1.png', 'bird2.png' and 'bird3.png'. Don't make it too fast.

Now, I would like to add pipes. For now, don't bother with collisions. They come by pair, one at the top ('pipe_top.png') and one at the bottom ('pipe_bottom.png'). They are separated by a gap which size is 5 times the bird's height. This gap is placed at a random height. The pipes appear on the right side of the screen, move from right to left, and disappear once they reach the left side. One pair of pipes appear every 2 seconds. Be careful with the randint function, the first argument must be less than the second.

Now can you add collisions? When the birds collides either with the ground or the pipes, the game ends.

I have 'base.png' for the ground, replace it.

Can you add a score system? When the bird crosses the gap between a pair of pipes, the score should be incremented by one.

Can you add a start screen and a game over screen? The start screen should appear when the player opens the game, and it should be written on it 'Press space to start'. The game over screen should appear when the player loses, and it should be written on it the score and 'Press space to start'. Don't forget to keep the functions.
