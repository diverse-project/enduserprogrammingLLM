# Python Flappy Bird Game

#### You:
Write a Flappy Bird game in python.

#### ChatGPT:
Creating a game like Flappy Bird involves graphics and real-time input, which is generally beyond the capabilities of a text-based interface like this one. However, I can provide you with a simple text-based game that operates on similar principles, or I can provide you with code for a graphical version of Flappy Bird that you can run on your own computer.

Here's an example of what a simple Python implementation of Flappy Bird might look like using Pygame, a popular game-making library in Python. You can run this code on your local machine.

```python
import pygame
import sys

# game variables
screen_width = 400
screen_height = 600
gravity = 0.25
bird_movement = 0
bird_y = screen_height / 2
pipe_height = 600
gap = 150

# initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# create the screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))

# set up game clock
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# load the bird and background images
bird = pygame.image.load('bird.png').convert_alpha()
background = pygame.image.load('background.png').convert_alpha()

# list to store pipes
pipes = []

# game loop
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                bird_movement = 0
                bird_movement -= 8
                
    bird_movement += gravity
    bird_y += bird_movement
    screen.blit(background, (0,0))
    screen.blit(bird, (100, bird_y))
    
    # draw pipes
    for pipe in pipes:
        screen.blit(pipe[0], pipe[1])
        screen.blit(pipe[2], pipe[3])
        
        # move the pipes to the left
        pipe[1].x -= 2
        pipe[3].x -= 2
        
    # create new pipes
    if len(pipes) == 0 or pipes[-1][1].x < screen_width - 200:
        new_pipe_top = pygame.image.load('pipe.png').convert_alpha()
        new_pipe_bottom = pygame.transform.flip(new_pipe_top, False, True)
        new_pipe_top_rect = new_pipe_top.get_rect(midbottom = (screen_width + 100, pipe_height - gap // 2))
        new_pipe_bottom_rect = new_pipe_bottom.get_rect(midtop = (screen_width + 100, pipe_height + gap // 2))
        pipes.append((new_pipe_top, new_pipe_top_rect, new_pipe_bottom, new_pipe_bottom_rect))
        
    # remove off-screen pipes
    if pipes[0][1].x < -new_pipe_top.get_width():
        pipes.pop(0)
    
    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(120)
```

Note that this is a very simple implementation and doesn't include many of the features you might expect from a full game, like scoring, collision detection, or game over conditions. It also assumes you have images for the bird, the background, and the pipes available.

The images should be in the same directory as your script, and should be named 'bird.png', 'background.png', and 'pipe.png', respectively. You would need to adjust this code to match the actual names and locations of your images. Also, keep in mind that Pygame needs to be installed on your system to run this code.

Please note that this code won't run in this current environment, as it's not designed to run graphical programs like games. You would need to run it on your local Python environment. If you have any questions about the code or how to run it, feel free to ask!


#### You:
The pipes should come by pair; one on top ('pipe_top.png'), and one at the bottom ('pipe_bottom.png'). They should be separated by a gap placed at a random height.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, I've updated the code to include two pipes for each obstacle: one on top and one on the bottom. The gap's height between the two pipes is randomized.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import pygame
import sys
import random

# game variables
screen_width = 400
screen_height = 600
gravity = 0.25
bird_movement = 0
bird_y = screen_height / 2
gap = 150

# initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# create the screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))

# set up game clock
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# load the bird and background images
bird = pygame.image.load('bird.png').convert_alpha()
background = pygame.image.load('background.png').convert_alpha()

# list to store pipes
pipes = []

def create_pipe():
    random_pipe_pos = random.randint(200, 400)
    bottom_pipe = pygame.image.load('pipe_bottom.png').convert_alpha()
    top_pipe = pygame.image.load('pipe_top.png').convert_alpha()
    bottom_pipe_rect = bottom_pipe.get_rect(midtop = (500, random_pipe_pos))
    top_pipe_rect = top_pipe.get_rect(midbottom = (500, random_pipe_pos - gap))
    return bottom_pipe, bottom_pipe_rect, top_pipe, top_pipe_rect

def move_pipes(pipes):
    for pipe in pipes:
        pipe[1].centerx -= 5
        pipe[3].centerx -= 5
    return pipes

def draw_pipes(pipes):
    for pipe in pipes:
        screen.blit(pipe[0], pipe[1])
        screen.blit(pipe[2], pipe[3])

# game loop
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                bird_movement = 0
                bird_movement -= 8
                
    bird_movement += gravity
    bird_y += bird_movement
    screen.blit(background, (0,0))
    screen.blit(bird, (100, bird_y))
    
    # pipes
    if len(pipes) == 0 or pipes[-1][1].x < screen_width - 200:
        pipes.append(create_pipe())
    pipes = move_pipes(pipes)
    draw_pipes(pipes)
    
    # remove off-screen pipes
    if pipes[0][1].right < 0:
        pipes.pop(0)
    
    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(120)
```

This version of the game creates a pair of pipes at a random height each time the previous pipes have moved a certain distance across the screen. The pipes then move to the left, and when they're no longer visible on the screen, they're removed from the list of pipes.

The images for the top and bottom pipes should be named 'pipe\_top.png' and 'pipe\_bottom.png' and should be located in the same directory as your script. You will need to adjust this code to match the actual names and locations of your images.

Remember, this code won't run in this current environment, but you can run it on your local Python environment. If you have any questions about the code or how to run it, feel free to ask!


#### You:
Now can you add collisions? Remember that it's a Flappy Bird game.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, let's add collision detection. In Flappy Bird, the game ends if the bird hits one of the pipes or the ground.

Here's how you can implement this:

```python
import pygame
import sys
import random

# game variables
screen_width = 400
screen_height = 600
gravity = 0.25
bird_movement = 0
bird_y = screen_height / 2
gap = 150

# initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# create the screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))

# set up game clock
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# load the bird and background images
bird = pygame.image.load('bird.png').convert_alpha()
background = pygame.image.load('background.png').convert_alpha()

# list to store pipes
pipes = []

def create_pipe():
    random_pipe_pos = random.randint(200, 400)
    bottom_pipe = pygame.image.load('pipe_bottom.png').convert_alpha()
    top_pipe = pygame.image.load('pipe_top.png').convert_alpha()
    bottom_pipe_rect = bottom_pipe.get_rect(midtop = (500, random_pipe_pos))
    top_pipe_rect = top_pipe.get_rect(midbottom = (500, random_pipe_pos - gap))
    return bottom_pipe, bottom_pipe_rect, top_pipe, top_pipe_rect

def move_pipes(pipes):
    for pipe in pipes:
        pipe[1].centerx -= 5
        pipe[3].centerx -= 5
    return pipes

def draw_pipes(pipes):
    for pipe in pipes:
        screen.blit(pipe[0], pipe[1])
        screen.blit(pipe[2], pipe[3])

def check_collision(pipes):
    for pipe in pipes:
        if bird_rect.colliderect(pipe[1]) or bird_rect.colliderect(pipe[3]):
            return False

    if bird_rect.top <= -100 or bird_rect.bottom >= 600:
        return False

    return True

# game loop
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                bird_movement = 0
                bird_movement -= 8
                
    bird_movement += gravity
    bird_y += bird_movement
    bird_rect = bird.get_rect(center = (100, bird_y))
    screen.blit(background, (0,0))
    screen.blit(bird, bird_rect)
    
    # pipes
    if len(pipes) == 0 or pipes[-1][1].x < screen_width - 200:
        pipes.append(create_pipe())
    pipes = move_pipes(pipes)
    draw_pipes(pipes)
    
    # check for collisions
    if not check_collision(pipes):
        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()
    
    # remove off-screen pipes
    if pipes[0][1].right < 0:
        pipes.pop(0)
    
    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(120)
```

In this code, I've added a `check_collision` function that checks if the bird's rectangle (`bird_rect`) is colliding with any part of the pipes or if the bird has hit the ground or moved off the top of the screen. If a collision is detected, the game ends by calling `pygame.quit()` and `sys.exit()`.

Remember, this code won't run in this current environment, but you can run it on your local Python environment. If you have any questions about the code or how to run it, feel free to ask!


#### You:
Can you add a score, and keep track of the high score in a separate txt file?

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely, we can keep track of the score and high score. We'll increment the score each time the bird successfully passes through a pair of pipes, and we'll store the high score in a separate text file.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import pygame
import sys
import random

# game variables
screen_width = 400
screen_height = 600
gravity = 0.25
bird_movement = 0
bird_y = screen_height / 2
gap = 150
score = 0
high_score = 0

# initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# create the screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))

# set up game clock
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# load the bird and background images
bird = pygame.image.load('bird.png').convert_alpha()
background = pygame.image.load('background.png').convert_alpha()

# load font for score display
game_font = pygame.font.Font(None, 50)

# list to store pipes
pipes = []

def create_pipe():
    random_pipe_pos = random.randint(200, 400)
    bottom_pipe = pygame.image.load('pipe_bottom.png').convert_alpha()
    top_pipe = pygame.image.load('pipe_top.png').convert_alpha()
    bottom_pipe_rect = bottom_pipe.get_rect(midtop = (500, random_pipe_pos))
    top_pipe_rect = top_pipe.get_rect(midbottom = (500, random_pipe_pos - gap))
    return bottom_pipe, bottom_pipe_rect, top_pipe, top_pipe_rect

def move_pipes(pipes):
    for pipe in pipes:
        pipe[1].centerx -= 5
        pipe[3].centerx -= 5
    return pipes

def draw_pipes(pipes):
    for pipe in pipes:
        screen.blit(pipe[0], pipe[1])
        screen.blit(pipe[2], pipe[3])

def check_collision(pipes):
    for pipe in pipes:
        if bird_rect.colliderect(pipe[1]) or bird_rect.colliderect(pipe[3]):
            return False

    if bird_rect.top <= -100 or bird_rect.bottom >= 600:
        return False

    return True

def update_score(score, high_score):
    if score > high_score:
        high_score = score
    return high_score

# game loop
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                bird_movement = 0
                bird_movement -= 8
                
    bird_movement += gravity
    bird_y += bird_movement
    bird_rect = bird.get_rect(center = (100, bird_y))
    screen.blit(background, (0,0))
    screen.blit(bird, bird_rect)
    
    # pipes
    if len(pipes) == 0 or pipes[-1][1].x < screen_width - 200:
        pipes.append(create_pipe())
    pipes = move_pipes(pipes)
    draw_pipes(pipes)
    
    # check for collisions
    if not check_collision(pipes):
        with open('high_score.txt', 'w') as f:
            f.write(str(high_score))
        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()

    # update score
    score += 0.01
    high_score = update_score(score, high_score)
    score_display = game_font.render(str(int(score)), True, (255, 255, 255))
    high_score_display = game_font.render(str(int(high_score)), True, (255, 255, 255))
    screen.blit(score_display, (screen_width / 2, 100))
    screen.blit(high_score_display, (screen_width / 2, 50))
    
    # remove off-screen pipes
    if pipes[0][1].right < 0:
        pipes.pop(0)
    
    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(120)
```

In this code, I've added a `score` variable that increments each time the game loop runs. The score is then displayed on the screen using Pygame's font rendering. I've also added a `high_score` variable that updates whenever the current score exceeds the previous high score. The high score is then written to a file called 'high\_score.txt' whenever the game ends.

Again, remember this code won't run in this current environment, but you can run it on your local Python environment. If you have any questions about the code or how to run it, feel free to ask!


#### You:
The highscore should also be read from the file.

#### ChatGPT:
Of course, let's update the code to read the high score from a file at the start of the game. If the file does not exist or cannot be read for some reason, we will assume the high score is zero.

Here is the updated code:

```python
import pygame
import sys
import random

# game variables
screen_width = 400
screen_height = 600
gravity = 0.25
bird_movement = 0
bird_y = screen_height / 2
gap = 150
score = 0

# initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# create the screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))

# set up game clock
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# load the bird and background images
bird = pygame.image.load('bird.png').convert_alpha()
background = pygame.image.load('background.png').convert_alpha()

# load font for score display
game_font = pygame.font.Font(None, 50)

# list to store pipes
pipes = []

# load high score from file
try:
    with open('high_score.txt', 'r') as f:
        high_score = int(f.read())
except:
    high_score = 0

def create_pipe():
    random_pipe_pos = random.randint(200, 400)
    bottom_pipe = pygame.image.load('pipe_bottom.png').convert_alpha()
    top_pipe = pygame.image.load('pipe_top.png').convert_alpha()
    bottom_pipe_rect = bottom_pipe.get_rect(midtop = (500, random_pipe_pos))
    top_pipe_rect = top_pipe.get_rect(midbottom = (500, random_pipe_pos - gap))
    return bottom_pipe, bottom_pipe_rect, top_pipe, top_pipe_rect

def move_pipes(pipes):
    for pipe in pipes:
        pipe[1].centerx -= 5
        pipe[3].centerx -= 5
    return pipes

def draw_pipes(pipes):
    for pipe in pipes:
        screen.blit(pipe[0], pipe[1])
        screen.blit(pipe[2], pipe[3])

def check_collision(pipes):
    for pipe in pipes:
        if bird_rect.colliderect(pipe[1]) or bird_rect.colliderect(pipe[3]):
            return False

    if bird_rect.top <= -100 or bird_rect.bottom >= 600:
        return False

    return True

def update_score(score, high_score):
    if score > high_score:
        high_score = score
    return high_score

# game loop
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            with open('high_score.txt', 'w') as f:
                f.write(str(int(high_score)))
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                bird_movement = 0
                bird_movement -= 8
                
    bird_movement += gravity
    bird_y += bird_movement
    bird_rect = bird.get_rect(center = (100, bird_y))
    screen.blit(background, (0,0))
    screen.blit(bird, bird_rect)
    
    # pipes
    if len(pipes) == 0 or pipes[-1][1].x < screen_width - 200:
        pipes.append(create_pipe())
    pipes = move_pipes(pipes)
    draw_pipes(pipes)
    
    # check for collisions
    if not check_collision(pipes):
        with open('high_score.txt', 'w') as f:
            f.write(str(int(high_score)))
        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()

    # update score
    score += 0.01
    high_score = update_score(score, high_score)
    score_display = game_font.render(str(int(score)), True, (255, 255, 255))
    high_score_display = game_font.render(str(int(high_score)), True, (255, 255, 255))
    screen.blit(score_display, (screen_width / 2, 100))
    screen.blit(high_score_display, (screen_width / 2, 50))
    
    # remove off-screen pipes
    if pipes[0][1].right < 0:
        pipes.pop(0)
    
    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(120)
```

This code first tries to open the file 'high\_score.txt' in read mode. If successful, it reads the high score from the file and assigns it to the `high_score` variable. If the file cannot be opened (for example, if it does not exist or there was an error reading the file), it sets `high_score` to 0.

This code won't run in this current environment, but you can run it on your local Python environment. If you have any questions about the code or how to run it, feel free to ask!

Can you add a start screen and a game over screen?

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, we can add a start screen and a game over screen. Here's an updated version of your code:

```python
import pygame
import sys
import random

# game variables
screen_width = 400
screen_height = 600
gravity = 0.3
bird_movement = 0
bird_y = screen_height / 2
gap = 150
score = 0
high_score = 0
game_active = False

# initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# create the screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))

# set up game clock
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# load the bird, background, and start and game over screens
bird = pygame.image.load('assets/bird.png').convert_alpha()
background = pygame.image.load('assets/background.png').convert_alpha()
game_over_screen = pygame.image.load('assets/game_over.png').convert_alpha()
start_screen = pygame.image.load('assets/start.png').convert_alpha()

# load font for score display
game_font = pygame.font.Font(None, 50)

# list to store pipes
pipes = []

# load high score from file
try:
    with open('assets/high_score.txt', 'r') as f:

    high_score = 0

def create_pipe():
    random_pipe_pos = random.randint(200, 400)
    bottom_pipe = pygame.image.load('assets/pipe_bottom.png').convert_alpha()
    top_pipe = pygame.image.load('assets/pipe_top.png').convert_alpha()
    bottom_pipe_rect = bottom_pipe.get_rect(midtop = (500, random_pipe_pos))
    top_pipe_rect = top_pipe.get_rect(midbottom = (500, random_pipe_pos - gap))
    return bottom_pipe, bottom_pipe_rect, top_pipe, top_pipe_rect

    if bird_rect.top <= -100 or bird_rect.bottom >= 600:
        return False

    return True

def update_score(score, high_score):
    if score > high_score:
        high_score = score
    return high_score

# game loop
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE and game_active:
                bird_movement = 0
                bird_movement -= 6
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE and game_active == False:

        bird_movement += gravity
        bird_y += bird_movement
        bird_rect = bird.get_rect(center = (100, bird_y))
        screen.blit(background, (0,0))
        screen.blit(bird, bird_rect)
        
        # pipes
        if len(pipes) == 0 or pipes[-1][1].x < screen_width - 200:
            pipes.append(create_pipe())
        pipes = move_pipes(pipes)
        draw_pipes(pipes)
        
        # check for collisions
        game_active = check_collision(pipes)
        
        # update score
        score += 0.01
        high_score = update_score(score, high_score)
        score_display = game_font.render(str(int(score)), True, (255, 255, 255))
        high_score_display = game_font.render(str(int(high_score)), True, (255, 255, 255))
        screen.blit(score_display, (screen_width / 2, 50))

            pipes.pop(0)
    else:
        screen.blit(start_screen, (0, 0))
        if score == 0:
            screen.blit(start_screen, (0, 0))
        else:
            screen.blit(game_over_screen, (0, 0))
    
    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(120)
```

In this version of the game, the game doesn't start immediately. Instead, the start screen is displayed until the space bar is pressed. After that, the game starts. If the bird collides with a pipe or the top or bottom of the screen, the game ends and the game over screen is displayed. Pressing the space bar again resets the game and starts a new round.

Remember to replace 'assets/start.png' and 'assets/game\_over.png' with the paths to your own images for the start and game over screens. As always, remember this code won't run in this current environment, but you can run it on your local Python environment. If you have any questions about the code or how to run it, feel free to ask!

#### ChatGPT:
I apologize for the confusion. The variable `bird_rect` was being defined inside the `if game_active:` condition, which caused a `NameError` when trying to access it in the `if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE and game_active == False:` condition.

You can fix this error by defining `bird_rect` before the main game loop. Here is the corrected version of your code:

In this version, `bird_rect` is defined before the main game loop starts, which ensures it's accessible throughout the entire script. The game loop then updates `bird_rect.center` as the bird moves.

Again, remember this code won't run in this current environment, but you can run it on your local Python environment. If you have any questions about the code or how to run it, feel free to ask!


#### You:
The start screen should display the title of the game, and offer to play. The game over screen should display the score, the high score and offer to play again. When playing again, the bird and pipes should return to their original positions.

#### ChatGPT:
Understood! We'll need to create text surfaces for the title, score, high score, and play instructions. We'll also reset the bird's position each time a new game starts. Here's an updated version of your code:

```

I created two new functions: `draw_start_screen()` and `draw_game_over_screen()`. The first one is called when the game is not active and the score is zero. It displays the game title and instructions to play. The second function is called when the game is not active and the score is not zero, i.e., after the bird has hit a pipe. It displays the score, the high score, and instructions to play again. When a new game starts, the bird's position and movement are reset to their initial values.

Again, remember this code won't run in this current environment, but you can run it on your local Python environment. If you have any questions about the code or how to run it, feel free to ask!

I apologize for the confusion. It seems I misunderstood your previous request. You asked for a start screen and a game over screen, but you didn't specify any specific images for these screens. I mistakenly added lines of code to load these non-existent images.

If you don't have specific images for these screens, we can create simple screens using Pygame's drawing functions and text rendering. Here's how you could do it:

In this version, `draw_start_screen()` and `draw_game_over_screen()` draw a semi-transparent white rectangle over the game screen and then draw the title, score, high score, and instructions on top of it. This creates a simple but effective start screen and game over screen.
