# Bird Flap Pygame Script

#### You:
Write a code in python. There is a bird ('bird.png') centered on the left side of the screen. The bird moves downward due to gravity, and flaps its wings to rise a constant height when the spacebar is pressed. When making the bird flap its wings, don't forget to reset the bird's speed to 0. Use the pygame library. The window size should be 800x600. Don't forget to implement a clock. Make sure that all variables are declared.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, I can help you write a basic Pygame script that would satisfy these requirements. Here's how you might do it:

```python
import pygame
import sys

# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# Set window size
WIN_WIDTH = 800
WIN_HEIGHT = 600

# Set gravity constant
GRAVITY = 1

# Set flap power
FLAP_POWER = 20

# Set clock
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# Load bird image
bird = pygame.image.load('bird.png')
bird_rect = bird.get_rect()

# Set bird start position
bird_rect.center = (WIN_WIDTH // 4, WIN_HEIGHT // 2)

# Set bird speed
bird_speed = 0

# Create window
win = pygame.display.set_mode((WIN_WIDTH, WIN_HEIGHT))

# Main game loop
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        # Quit game if close button is pressed
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        # Make the bird flap if spacebar is pressed
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                bird_speed = 0
                bird_speed -= FLAP_POWER

    # Apply gravity
    bird_speed += GRAVITY
    bird_rect.centery += bird_speed

    # Draw bird
    win.blit(bird, bird_rect)

    # Update display
    pygame.display.update()

    # Cap the framerate
    clock.tick(60)
```

Please note that this script assumes you have an image file named 'bird.png' in the same directory where this script is running. Also, this script does not include any collision detection or game over conditions, it's a very basic script that just gets a bird flapping and falling due to gravity. If you want to extend this into a full game, you'll need to add more code to handle those aspects.

As of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021, the assistant does not have the capability to execute pygame or any other graphics-based libraries, so please run this code in your local environment.


#### You:
Now, can you add animations and rotation to the bird? I have 3 frames : 'bird1.png', 'bird2.png' and 'bird3.png'. Don't make it too fast.

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, I can add animations and rotations to the bird. Here's how you might modify the script to include these changes:

```python
import pygame
import sys

# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# Set window size
WIN_WIDTH = 800
WIN_HEIGHT = 600

# Set gravity constant
GRAVITY = 1

# Set flap power
FLAP_POWER = 20

# Set clock
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# Load bird images for animation
bird_frames = [pygame.image.load(f'bird{i}.png') for i in range(1, 4)]
bird_index = 0

# Set bird start position
bird_rect = bird_frames[0].get_rect()
bird_rect.center = (WIN_WIDTH // 4, WIN_HEIGHT // 2)

# Set bird speed
bird_speed = 0

# Create window
win = pygame.display.set_mode((WIN_WIDTH, WIN_HEIGHT))

# Time counter for animations
ANIMATION_TIME = 200
time_since_last_frame = 0

# Main game loop
while True:
    dt = clock.tick(60)  # time elapsed since last frame in milliseconds

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        # Quit game if close button is pressed
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        # Make the bird flap if spacebar is pressed
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                bird_speed = 0
                bird_speed -= FLAP_POWER

    # Apply gravity
    bird_speed += GRAVITY
    bird_rect.centery += bird_speed

    # Rotate bird
    bird_angle = bird_speed * -1  # invert angle for natural direction

    # Animate bird
    time_since_last_frame += dt
    if time_since_last_frame > ANIMATION_TIME:
        time_since_last_frame = 0
        bird_index = (bird_index + 1) % 3  # loop over 3 frames
        bird = bird_frames[bird_index]

    rotated_bird = pygame.transform.rotate(bird, bird_angle)

    # Draw bird
    win.blit(rotated_bird, bird_rect)

    # Update display
    pygame.display.update()
```

This code adds animation by cycling through the three bird images. It also includes rotation, with the bird tilting upwards when flapping and downwards when falling. The bird's rotation is based on its speed, which means it will tilt further downwards the faster it falls. The rotation and animation are not too fast, but you can adjust the speed by changing the `ANIMATION_TIME` and `bird_angle` variables. As with the previous script, this one does not include collision detection or game over conditions.


#### You:
Now, I would like to add a blue background and a ground ('base.png'). The ground doesn't need to be moving.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here is how you would add a static ground and a blue background to your Pygame window:

```python
import pygame
import sys

# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# Set window size
WIN_WIDTH = 800
WIN_HEIGHT = 600

# Set gravity constant
GRAVITY = 1

# Set flap power
FLAP_POWER = 20

# Set clock
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# Load bird images for animation
bird_frames = [pygame.image.load(f'bird{i}.png') for i in range(1, 4)]
bird_index = 0

# Set bird start position
bird_rect = bird_frames[0].get_rect()
bird_rect.center = (WIN_WIDTH // 4, WIN_HEIGHT // 2)

# Set bird speed
bird_speed = 0

# Load ground image
base = pygame.image.load('base.png')
base_rect = base.get_rect(bottomleft=(0, WIN_HEIGHT))

# Set background color
BG_COLOR = (0, 120, 255)  # RGB for light blue

# Create window
win = pygame.display.set_mode((WIN_WIDTH, WIN_HEIGHT))

# Time counter for animations
ANIMATION_TIME = 200
time_since_last_frame = 0

# Main game loop
while True:
    dt = clock.tick(60)  # time elapsed since last frame in milliseconds

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        # Quit game if close button is pressed
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        # Make the bird flap if spacebar is pressed
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
                bird_speed = 0
                bird_speed -= FLAP_POWER

    # Apply gravity
    bird_speed += GRAVITY
    bird_rect.centery += bird_speed

    # Rotate bird
    bird_angle = bird_speed * -1  # invert angle for natural direction

    # Animate bird
    time_since_last_frame += dt
    if time_since_last_frame > ANIMATION_TIME:
        time_since_last_frame = 0
        bird_index = (bird_index + 1) % 3  # loop over 3 frames
        bird = bird_frames[bird_index]

    rotated_bird = pygame.transform.rotate(bird, bird_angle)

    # Draw background
    win.fill(BG_COLOR)

    # Draw ground
    win.blit(base, base_rect)

    # Draw bird
    win.blit(rotated_bird, bird_rect)

    # Update display
    pygame.display.update()
```

This code adds a ground image at the bottom of the window and sets the background color to light blue. The background is drawn before the ground and the bird to ensure they appear on top. Adjust the `BG_COLOR` variable as needed to get your desired shade of blue. As always, this script assumes that the images you specified ('base.png', 'bird1.png', 'bird2.png', 'bird3.png') are in the same directory as your script.


#### You:
Now, I would like to add pipes. For now, don't bother with collisions. Create a Pipe class, with the functions __init__(self,x,gap_y), move(self) and draw(self). Outside of this class, create a spawn_pipe() function. The pipes come by pair, one at the top ('pipe_top.png') and one at the bottom ('pipe_bottom.png'). They are separated by a gap which size is 5 times the bird's height. This gap is placed at a random height, between 100 and the height of the window minus the gap minus 100. The pipes appear on the right side of the screen, move from right to left, and disappear once they reach the left side. One pair of pipes appear every 2 seconds. 

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here's a version of your script that includes pipes:

```python
import pygame

        self.gap_y = gap_y
        self.top = self.gap_y - bird_rect.height * 2.5  # gap size is 5 bird heights
        self.bottom = self.gap_y + bird_rect.height * 2.5

def spawn_pipe():
    gap_y = random.randrange(100, WIN_HEIGHT - bird_rect.height * 5 - 100)  # bird_rect.height * 5 is the gap size

    # Remove pipes that have gone off screen
    pipes = [pipe for pipe in pipes if pipe.x + pipe_top.get_width() > 0]

    # Update display
    pygame.display.update()
```

This script adds a `Pipe` class that represents a pair of pipes, one at the top and one at the bottom of the screen. Each pipe pair is separated by a gap that is 5 times the bird's height. The gap is placed at a random height, with the restriction that it cannot be too close to the top or bottom of the window. The pipes move from right to left, and once they reach the left side of the window, they are removed from the list of pipes. Every 2 seconds, a new pair of pipes is spawned on the right side of the window. The images for the top and bottom pipes ('pipe\_top.png' and 'pipe\_bottom.png') should be in the same directory as your script.


#### You:
Now can you add collisions? When the birds collides either with the ground or the pipes, the game ends.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here's how you can add collision detection to your script:

```python

def spawn_pipe():
    gap_y = random.randrange(100, WIN_HEIGHT - bird_rect.height * 5 - 100)  # bird_rect.height * 5 is the gap size

           bird_rect.colliderect(pygame.Rect(pipe.x, pipe.bottom, pipe_bottom.get_width(), WIN_HEIGHT - pipe.bottom)):
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()

    # Remove pipes that have gone off screen
    pipes = [pipe for pipe in pipes if pipe.x + pipe_top.get_width() > 0]

    # Update display
    pygame.display.update()
```

This script checks for collisions between the bird and the ground or the pipes in every frame. If a collision is detected, the game ends by calling `pygame.quit()` and `sys.exit()`. The collision detection for the pipes is done by creating `pygame.Rect` objects for the top and bottom pipes in each pair and checking for collisions with the bird's Rect.


#### You:
Now can you add a score system? When the bird crosses the gap between a pair of pipes, the score should be incremented by one.

    # Update display

```

This script adds a score that increments every time the bird passes through a pair of pipes. The score is displayed in the top center of the window in white text. When a pipe pair is passed, its `passed` attribute is set to `True` to ensure the score is only incremented once per pair. The score is drawn after the bird and the pipes to ensure it appears on top. When the bird collides with the ground or a pipe, the game ends and the final score is the number of pipe pairs passed.


#### You:
Now, can you add a start screen and a game over screen? The start screen should appear when the player opens the game, and it should be written on it 'Press space to start'. The game over screen should appear when the player loses, and it should be written on it the score and 'Press space to start'. Make sure that when restarting, the bird is at its initial position.

Sure, here's how you can add start and game over screens:

In this script, the game state is controlled by the `game_state` variable, which can be 'start', 'play', or 'game over'. When the game is first opened, the game state is 'start', and the start screen is displayed. Pressing space starts the game and changes the game state to 'play'. If the bird collides with the ground or a pipe, the game state is changed to 'game over', and the game over screen is displayed. Pressing space on the game over screen resets the game and changes the game state back to 'start'. When the game is reset, the bird is moved back to its initial position, the pipes are cleared, and the score is reset to 0.

Finally, can you keep track of the highscore in a separate txt file? It should also be displayed on the game over screen.

This script checks if a file named 'high\_score.txt' exists when the game starts. If it does, the high score is loaded from the file. If it doesn't, the high score is set to 0. Whenever the bird collides with the ground or a pipe, the score is compared to the high score, and if it's higher, the high score is updated and written to the file. On the game over screen, both the score and the high score are displayed.

I've moved the `bird = bird_frames[bird_index]` line outside the while loop, so that it is defined before the game enters the loop. Inside the loop, the `bird` variable is updated during the bird animation section, as it was in the previous version of the code. This should resolve the `NameError` you encountered.
