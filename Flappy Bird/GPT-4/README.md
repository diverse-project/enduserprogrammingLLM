In each folder are the different approaches I could think of to get ChatGPT to write code.

- 1st method: We give a working code to ChatGPT and ask it to write us a prompt able to give us a similar code. Since they're quite similar, I didn't try the 2nd method with GPT-4.
- 3rd method: Simple prompt (Write a Flappy Bird game in python).
- 4th method: Simple description of what the game should include.
- 5th method: A series of requests that I give to ChatGPT, without changing the code between them.
- t = 0: When the temperature is set to 0 on the playground.
